      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      <span style={{color: '#A68E90', fontWeight: 'bold', fontSize: 23}}>A</span>s the spiritual successor to the legendary McLaren F1, the 2020 McLaren Speedtail evokes similar desires with its one-of-a-kind design and out-of-this-world performance. The streamlined speedster is the fastest and most powerful McLaren ever built, and it represents the pinnacle of the company's exotic lineup.

      <h3>Engine Ride and Handling</h3>
      <p>
      <span style={{color: '#A68E90', fontWeight: 'bold', fontSize: 23}}>W</span>hile full powertrain details are unknown, we do know that the rear-drive 2020 Speedtail has a hybrid system that develops a total of 1035 horsepower courtesy of its gasoline engine and electric motors. Combined with an incredibly aerodynamic shape and ultra-lightweight construction, the Speedtail can reach a claimed top speed of 250 mph. Likewise, McLaren says it will accelerate from zero to 186 mph in 12.8 seconds. That makes it significantly quicker than the almighty McLaren P1, which did the deed in 16.5 seconds. It has a set of Pirelli P Zero tires that were specially developed to handle extreme speeds and wrap the staggered 20- and 21-inch wheels. The hybrid hypercar also can be lowered by 1.4 inches and includes a Velocity drive mode that optimizes aerodynamics and powertrain settings for high-speed runs.

      <h3>Interior and Technology</h3>
      <p>
      <span style={{color: '#A68E90', fontWeight: 'bold', fontSize: 23}}>U</span>nlike the track-focused McLaren Senna, the 2020 Speedtail provides a more luxurious experience. Swing open the power-operated dihedral doors that reveal its teardrop-shaped cockpit and behold a three-seat layout that was last seen on the F1. The unique setup features a central driving position with a passenger seat on either side. The interior features lightweight and premium materials, along with touchscreens that replace most of the traditional switchgear. A strip of electrochromic glass with adjustable darkness is used instead of sun visors to protect passengers from the sun. The Speedtail's unmistakable exterior is made entirely of carbon-fiber body panels and sports distinct details such as retractable rearview-camera mirrors and static aero covers on the front wheels. While only the wealthiest enthusiasts can afford the Speedtail's $2.1 million price tag, just 106 will be built and all of them are already sold.
