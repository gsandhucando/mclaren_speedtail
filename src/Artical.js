      <h3>Engine Ride and Handling</h3>
      <p>
      <span style={{color: '#A68E90', fontWeight: 'bold', fontSize: 23}}>W</span>hile full powertrain details are unknown, we do know that the rear-drive 2020 Speedtail has a hybrid system that develops a total of 1035 horsepower courtesy of its gasoline engine and electric motors. Combined with an incredibly aerodynamic shape and ultra-lightweight construction, the Speedtail can reach a claimed top speed of 250 mph. Likewise, McLaren says it will accelerate from zero to 186 mph in 12.8 seconds. That makes it significantly quicker than the almighty McLaren P1, which did the deed in 16.5 seconds. It has a set of Pirelli P Zero tires that were specially developed to handle extreme speeds and wrap the staggered 20- and 21-inch wheels. The hybrid hypercar also can be lowered by 1.4 inches and includes a Velocity drive mode that optimizes aerodynamics and powertrain settings for high-speed runs.
